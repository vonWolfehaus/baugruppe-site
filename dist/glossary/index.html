Multi-story, <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2014/05/08/ready-set-build-collectively/">multi-family buildings</a> (think condos) rather than detached or semi-detached housing. There is no requirement for community space or common facilities, though many incorporate them (commonly: gardens, community rooms, roof terraces). However, like cohousing, <em>baugruppen</em> incorporate a participatory planning process. The largest difference is that <em>baugruppen</em> are generally funded without developers (they are self-financed).</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Building co-operative:</span> Co-operative housing corporation where individuals or families work together to directly construct their own homes in a cooperative fashion. Individuals usually own what they built afterwards, with common areas still owned by the co-op.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Cohousing:</span> A <a href="http://www.cohousing.org/what_is_cohousing">community of private homes</a> clustered around shared space, usually within a suburban or rural context. The homes are privately-owned while the land is group-owned, usually under an LLC legal entity, and developer-financed. Shared outdoor space may include parking, walkways, open space, and gardens. Neighbors also share resources like tools and lawnmowers. Further differentiations exist within cohousing - <a href="http://www.cohousing.org/glossary">visit the Coho/US</a> glossary to learn more.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Collective building:</span> <em>(closest English equivelant of &quot;baugruppen&quot;)</em> A community of like-minded people that come together to design, fund (no developers), build, and inhabit a multi-unit structure in a dense urban environment. Each private unit functions like any other condo unit. There&#39;s usually a common area, community garden and solar panels on the roof terrace, and a guest unit. Sometimes the entire ground floor is leased out to restaurants or retail stores.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Coliving:</span> Multiple individuals sharing a dwelling, usually a single house that is owned by one or more of the members.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Commune:</span> The only type of community organized around sharing almost everything. Yes, the kind hippies formed in the 1970&#39;s. It is rarely successful in the long-term, usually due to social and/or financial problems.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Ecovillage:</span> A community whose inhabitants seek to live according to ecological principles, causing as little impact on the environment as possible. Usually just a specific theme of cohousing.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Intentional community:</span> An intentional community is a planned residential community designed from the start to have a high degree of social cohesion and teamwork. The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political, professional, or spiritual vision that provides a baseline social fabric. <em><b>NOTE:</b></em> All of the terms on this page are types of intentional communities.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Student Housing or Co-ops:</span> Usually a dormatory or shared house specifically themed around student work.</p><p><span class="glossary__term-title">Transition Towns:</span> The terms <b>transition town</b>, <b>transition initiative</b> and <b>transition model</b> refer to <a href="https://transitionnetwork.org/what">grassroot community projects</a> that aim to increase self-sufficiency to reduce the potential effects of peak oil, climate destruction, and economic instability. They usually materialize in neighborhoods and ecovillages, where there&#39;s much more emphasis on creating community-owned businesses like bakeries, breweries, and farms. They also generate thier own energy through sustainable technology, mainly solar and wind.</p></div></section><footer class="mdl-mini-footer"><div class="mdl-mini-footer__left-section"><div class="mdl-logo">Learn:</div><ul class="mdl-mini-footer__link-list"><li><a href="/">Intro</a></li><li><a href="/process">Process</a></li><li><a href="/building">Building</a></li><li><a href="/glossary">Glossary</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li></ul></div><div class="mdl-mini-footer__right-section"><img src="/favicon.png" style="width: 60px; height: auto"></div></footer></main></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){

Collective buildings incorporate a participatory planning process, without developers (if possible - it&#39;s where most of the cost savings is made). While mostly popular in Germany, the UK also <a href="http://customandselfbuildtoolkit.org.uk/">has helpful guidance</a> on the process.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="section--center mdl-grid mdl-grid--no-spacing mdl-shadow--2dp"><div class="mdl-card mdl-grid mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col"><div class="mdl-card__supporting-text"><h5 id="formation">Formation</h5><p>The group meets, the early members recruit additional members, they search for experts to help them, and they try to identify a suitable site. Early conceptual designs are often produced (with outline costs) so that the members can visualize roughly what they propose to do and what it might cost. The group usually then formally constitutes itself as a co-operative, a civil legal partnership, or a home ownership association.</p><h5 id="planning">Planning</h5><p>This is when the group firms up the appointment of its professional team (architects, engineers, etc), and identifies a project manager to oversee the construction work. At this stage the members might also obtain an &quot;option&quot; to buy the site they&#39;ve identified, and they will get their scheme approved by the planners. The design is then finalized at this point, while the costs are worked out in detail, and they get their finance lined up.</p><p>You will have a much harder time finding lots in the bigger US cities like New York, San Francisco, and Seattle, so in this case it&#39;s best to hire a realtor to do the footwork. Berlin has a big advantage over many UK cities in that there is a good supply of reasonably priced urban plots.</p><p>In Germany, the state owned bank KfW is a strong supporter of these types of projects, so funding is often relatively straight forward. The GLS Bank also has a remit to lend to community-led housing projects. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t nearly this level of support in the US (yet), but <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2014/06/24/baugruppen-yes-in-our-back-yard/">it will get there</a>.</p><h5 id="prep">Purchase and Prepare</h5><p>At this point the group formally purchases the land. It goes out to building contractors to get firm prices and it selects the builder it wants to do the work.</p><h5 id="build">Build</h5><p>This is the construction phase, so the project manager that the group has hired takes care of checking the quality of the work, controlling the cash and ensuring the project is completed when it should be. Quite often the members of the group get involved in some of the work to help keep costs down – so its quite common for them to tackle the final fitting out, decorating, and the installation of kitchens and bathrooms.</p><h5 id="occupation">Occupation</h5><p>Everyone moves in and a building management committee is set up to ensure the homes are properly maintained. Communities usually host an open house for tours, and then of course the well-earned private celebration to kick off a wonderful new life full of community belonging!</p></div></div></section><section class="section--center mdl-grid mdl-grid--no-spacing mdl-shadow--2dp"><div class="mdl-card mdl-grid mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col"><div class="mdl-card__supporting-text"><h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4><p>It sounds fantastic, but sometimes things do go wrong – no system is perfect. For example, members may disagree about what they want from the project, some people leave groups at critical stages, and with any construction project there can be cost and time overruns.</p><p>Many communities attend workshops on conflict resolution and project management, or even hire professional coaches to help teach members how to conduct themselves during collaborative processes and meetings.</p><p>Of course, it&#39;s also exhausting – people need to be able to devote a lot of time to it, and there can be a lot of (sometimes tiresome) meetings. But a recent survey of people who had done it suggests that most rate the experience as a positive one, and they forgot their disagreements as these memories were outweighed by the delight of their achievements.</p></div></div></section><footer class="mdl-mini-footer"><div class="mdl-mini-footer__left-section"><div class="mdl-logo">Learn:</div><ul class="mdl-mini-footer__link-list"><li><a href="/">Intro</a></li><li><a href="/process">Process</a></li><li><a href="/building">Building</a></li><li><a href="/glossary">Glossary</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li></ul></div><div class="mdl-mini-footer__right-section"><img src="/favicon.png" style="width: 60px; height: auto"></div></footer></main></div><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){

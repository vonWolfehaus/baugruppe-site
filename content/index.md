			<h4>What is collective building?</h4>
			<p>Collective building is when a group of like-minded people come together to design, fund, build, and inhabit a multi-unit structure. Combined with a deep respect for privacy, no shared economy, and non-hierarchical governance, these intentional communities redefine our social context.</p>

				<p>Many communities are built to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivhaus">passivhaus</a> standards, with tons of insulation, natural light, and fresh air circulation. They can have solar panels, batteries, and smart appliances, all networked together by a smart whole-home energy management system. It could create more energy than it consumes and have the ability to island itself from the grid in the case of emergency.</p>

			<h4>What are the costs involved?</h4>
			<img src="images/currency_silver.png" class="pull-right" style="margin-left: 30px;">
			<p style="font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 15px;">_This following is a lightly edited excerpt from the excellent <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/category/baugruppen/">Urbanist series</a> on baugruppen – visit the link below_</p>
			<p>There are a couple of ways a _baugruppe_ reduces costs over traditional models. First and foremost, bypassing a developer pulls out the profit they would take on a project, which is not insubstantial. Second, there is little to no marketing of the project – which means no staging/pursuit. Realtors are also generally not in the equation.<p>
			<p>The down payment for a _baugruppe_ can be in the realm of 30%, so upfront costs are higher. In the long run, the total costs are lower, and the monthly payment ends up being pretty affordable as well. The savings rates in Germany, France and Switzerland are roughly triple what they are in the US, so this also changes the equation.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, the collective economic might of _baugruppen_ offers owner-builders an opportunity for significant savings over traditional developer-driven models, resulting in about 15% savings on average. For less cost than typical development, owners get a higher-quality product designed to meet their needs; and in Germany, this product is usually more energy efficient, thus ensuring operational cost savings as well.</p>

		<h5>How do I find a _baugruppe_?</h5>
		You'll need to use German websites for that. However, for other community types there's already a great resource at the [cohousing directory](http://www.ic.org/directory/intentional-communities-by-country/). You can also find excellent resources for how to get started on the [NICA wiki](http://www.ic.org/wiki/nica/), in addition to [Cohousing.org]().

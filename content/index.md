			<h4>What's a <i>baugruppe</i>?</h4>
			<i>Baugruppe</i>--German for "building group"--is collectively-funded community-based living, where a like-minded group comes together to design, build, and inhabit a condo-like building in a city environment. <b>It's an urban collective, a custom community created by you, for you!</b>

				Most <i>baugruppen</i> are built to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivhaus">passivhaus</a> standards, with tons of insulation, natural light, and fresh air circulation. They can have solar panels, batteries, and smart appliances, all networked together by a smart whole-home energy management system. It could create more energy than it consumes and have the ability to island itself from the grid in the case of emergency.

			<h4>How much does this cost?</h4>
			There are a number of ways to fund development, but a lot of savings is achieved by cutting out developers. The project is often lead by an architect. with everyone purchasing his or her unit in the building on spec before it had even been developed. The bank and project manager structured a package of financing by pooling the individual mortgages for the units of future residents that would fund all the phases of construction.
		</div>
		<div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
			This unusual method of financing was made possible by specialized programs offered by Nürnberg’s UmweltBank, the self-styled “greenest” bank in the economic ecology of Europe’s financial leader. The invisible hands of the market can strum a sitar, if need be.

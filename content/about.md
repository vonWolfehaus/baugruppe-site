	<h4>About this website</h4>
	<p>Eagerly created by Corey Birnbaum, this site is the beginnings of his effort to develop software that enables people to find, build, and maintain [resilient communities](http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2008/01/the-resilient-c.html).</p>
	<h4>The story so far</h4>
	<p>After a decade of searching, it has become clear that the idea's time has come. The idea appears as many different terms, each as its own slight variation: _baugruppen_, co-housing, intentional communities, building cooperatives, or pocket neighborhoods. It even has traction in a more ambitious context as [Transition Towns](https://www.transitionnetwork.org/), [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/), or the [Global EcoVillage](http://gen.ecovillage.org/). There are now a [whole](http://www.resilientus.org/about-us/what-is-community-resilience/) [host](http://www.resilience.org/communities-guide) of [supportive](http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/resilience.php) [institutions](http://www.resilientamerica.org/) built around the idea of creating self-reliant, tight-knit and sustainable communities.</p>
	<p>Millions of people are now working on this idea, but it appears to be prevalent only in Europe, most notably in Germany. Many [want](http://grist.org/cities/i-want-to-live-in-a-baugruppe/) to make this happen, but the going is too slow. There is also a severe lack of compiled resources online, with absolutely no online tools that make the collaboration process better.</p>
	<p>So in 2015, Corey began building a solution. Since the idea has yet to gain significant traction outside of Europe, the first order of business is to inform people!</p>

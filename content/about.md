	<h4>About this website</h4>
	<p>Created by Corey Birnbaum out of sheer passion (and a bit of code), this site is the very beginning of his effort to develop software that enables people to find, build, and maintain [resilient communities](http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2008/01/the-resilient-c.html).</p>
	<h4>The story</h4>
	<p>After about a decade of searching, it had become clear that the idea's time has come. The idea appears as many different terms, each with its own slight variation of the theme: baugruppen, co-housing, intentional communities, building cooperatives, or pocket neighborhoods. It even has traction in a more ambitious context as Transition Towns, <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/">Open Source Ecology</a>, or the <a href="http://gen.ecovillage.org/">Global EcoVillage</a>. There are now a [whole](http://www.resilientus.org/about-us/what-is-community-resilience/) [host](http://www.resilience.org/communities-guide) of [supportive](http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/resilience.php) [institutions](http://www.resilientamerica.org/) built around the idea of creating self-empowered, sustainable communities.</p>
	<p>In 2015 Corey began writing the software that he envisioned would be necessary to maintain the cohesion of a networked community. At the beginning of 2016 he discovered that, once again, Germany was already at the forefront. I met with Mike who helped me understand what baugruppen are, and that more than anything, people outside Europe needed to know there was a better way to construct communities and, by extension, cities. And so it begins with this humble website...</p>

	<h4>About this website</h4>
	<p>Created by [Corey Birnbaum](http://coreybirnbaum.com/), this site is the beginnings of a global effort to develop software that enables people to learn about, find, build, and maintain resilient intentional communities.</p>
	<p>Critical contributions were made by Grace Kim of [Schemata Workshop](http://www.schemataworkshop.com/) and [Mike Eliason](http://fuckyeahbaugruppen.tumblr.com/).</p>
	<h4>The story so far</h4>
	<p>The idea of intentional community has finally evolved into something practical for the modern times. It appears as [many different terms](/glossary). It even has traction in a more ambitious context as [Transition Towns](https://www.transitionnetwork.org/), [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/), or the [Global EcoVillage](http://gen.ecovillage.org/). There are now a [whole](http://www.resilientus.org/about-us/what-is-community-resilience/) [host](http://www.resilience.org/communities-guide) of [supportive](http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/resilience.php) [institutions](http://www.resilientamerica.org/) built around the idea of creating self-reliant, tight-knit, and sustainable communities.</p>
	<p>Millions of people are now working on this idea, but it appears to be prevalent only in Europe -- most notably in Germany -- with high growth in the UK. Many [want](http://grist.org/cities/i-want-to-live-in-a-baugruppe/) to make this happen, but the going is too slow. There is also a severe lack of compiled resources online, with no dedicated apps that make the collaboration process for intentional communities better. There is also little to no emphasis on capturing the attention of younger generations, as well as a complete lack of networking tools.</p>
	<p>So in 2016, development of a solution began. Since the idea has yet to gain significant traction outside of Europe, the first order of business was to inform -- the result of which is the website you're reading. The next stages are currently in development by multiple parties, with more information coming in 2018.</p>

		<h2>Buildings and spaces</h2>
		<p><i>Baugruppen</i> have the option of pushing as far as their budget will allow in terms of materials and structure. The group may feel that certain forms of construction are advantageous in terms of embodied energy or carbon (eg  versus concrete) â€“ and it's entirely possible given the right approach, those methods may even cost less as well. For the <i>baugruppen</i>, being ecologically-minded may not be an afterthought, they may even be willing to take on the risk of an all-wood building whereas a risk-averse developer might avoid that route. They can debate the merits of EPS, XPS, and cork in financial terms, but also through these other lenses.</p>

		<p>_Baugruppen_ have the option of pushing as far as their budget will allow in terms of materials and structure. For the _baugruppen_, being ecologically-minded may not be an afterthought. They may even be willing to take on the risk of using [cross-laminated timber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLqiwBL28v4) or even [rammed earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth), whereas a risk-averse developer might avoid those routes. This freedom allows groups to create structures based on their priorities, be it sustainability, durability, flexibility, or anything else in-between.</p>
		<p>These are various features that past groups have chosen, and provide ideas for other wonderful possibilities.</p>
		<h5 id="Passivhaus">Passivhaus</h5>
		<p>Many _baugruppen_ are built to the [Passivhaus](http://passiv.de/en/) standard. The requirements enforce the overall energy efficiency of a structure, which results in proper insulation, ventilation, and uses less electricity for heating and cooling. The air quality [benefits immensely](http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/standard.jsp?id=122) from these thermal performance requirements while also reducing electric bills significantly.</p>
		<h5 id="Energy">Renewable energy</h5>
		<p>The benefits of utilizing renewable energy are obvious, but the upfront cost is still prohibitive. However, with a _baugruppe_ that barrier is lowered due to the collective contributions of its members, making this option extremely attractive, especially since it reduces their reliance on fragile national power grids.</p>
		<p>Living in a community that generates its own power also provides an enormous amount of security, as disastrous events become manageable while also becoming an opportunity to give back to the city in times of need.</p>
		<p>Becoming fully self-reliant is now a real possibility due to breakthrough technology such as Tesla's [Powerwall](https://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall). A _baugruppe_ could invest in a Tesla Powerpack to store energy for the entire group, further reducing individual costs and maintenance.</p>

		<h5 id="Food">Edible gardens</h5>
		<p>Large, multi-building complexes such as the wonderful [Newton Project](http://www.newtonprojekt.de) (pictured above) are prime _baugruppen_ for creating substantial spaces dedicated to growing local, organic food for both the residents and the surrounding community. Many smaller groups opt for a rooftop terrace with a smaller garden and lounge area.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Regardless of size, many communities (not just _baugruppen_) are developing public spaces that supply residents with a substantial amount of food on a consistent basis. Some implement [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) systems to greatly increase their yield, quality, and ease of maintenance. A more advanced and perhaps even more productive system could include [aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics), further increasing a group's self-reliance to the point of supplying a majority of their needs completely independent of the city.</p>
		<p>More family-oriented groups tend to add playgrounds and other common areas where children and adults alike can enjoy a sunny day.</p>
		<h5 id="Scale">Communities in context</h5>
		<p>Some cities in Germany offer a fantastic amount of support for _baugruppen_ and have processes in place based on experience. One such requirement is that the first floor of any development must be left as retail space. This ensures that the complex maintains activity throughout the day, and not leaving the community to become a residential black hole. Instead, business thrive at such dense locations while also providing convenient products and services to residents.</p>
		<p>In an enterprising community, members could take this concept to the next step by establishing their own business that would not only benefit the surrounding residents but also themselves. Such businesses could include a tool library, machine shop, 3D printing services, or even something more traditional like a restaurant that serves the food grown in their own gardens.</p>

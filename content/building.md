		<p>_Baugruppen_ have the option of pushing as far as their budget will allow in terms of materials and structure. For the _baugruppen_, being ecologically-minded may not be an afterthought. They may even be willing to take on the risk of using [cross-laminated timber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLqiwBL28v4) or [rammed earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammed_earth), whereas a risk-averse developer might avoid those routes. This freedom allows groups to create structures based on _their_ priorities.</p>
		<p>Listed here are various features that past groups have chosen, as well as some ideas for other wonderful possibilities.</p>

		<h5 id="Passivhaus">Passivhaus</h5>
		<p>Many _baugruppen_ are built to the [Passivhaus](http://passiv.de/en/) standard. The requirements enforce the overall energy efficiency of a structure, which results in proper [insulation](http://elrondburrell.com/blog/passivhaus-hermetically-sealed/), ventilation, and energy consumption. The air quality [benefits immensely](http://www.passivhaus.org.uk/standard.jsp?id=122) from these thermal performance requirements while also reducing the cost of electricity bills significantly.</p>
		<h5 id="Energy">Renewable energy</h5>
		<p>The benefits of utilizing renewable energy are obvious, but the upfront cost is still somewhat prohibitive. However, with a _baugruppe_ that barrier is lowered due to the collective contributions of its members, making this option extremely attractive.</p>
		<p>Living in a building that generates its own power provides a fantastic amount of security, as disastrous events become manageable while also becoming an opportunity to give back to the city in times of need. It's also extremely helpful during nominal operations, since local utility systems exhibit a disturbing level of fragility with blackouts still occurring on a semi-regular basis throughout the world.</p>
		<p>Becoming fully self-reliant is now a real possibility due to breakthrough technology such as Tesla's [Powerwall](https://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall). A _baugruppe_ could invest in a Tesla Powerpack to store energy for the entire group, further reducing individual costs and maintenance time.</p>

		<h5 id="Food">Edible gardens</h5>
		<p>Large, multi-building complexes such as the wonderful [Newton Project](http://www.newtonprojekt.de) (pictured above) are prime _baugruppen_ for creating substantial spaces dedicated to growing local, organic food for both the residents and the surrounding community. Many smaller groups opt for a rooftop terrace with a smaller garden that includes a lounge area.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Regardless of size, many communities (not just _baugruppen_) are developing public spaces that supply residents with a substantial amount of food on a consistent basis. Some implement [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture) systems to greatly increase their yield, quality, and ease of maintenance. A more advanced and perhaps even more productive system could include [aquaponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics), further increasing a group's self-reliance to the point of supplying a majority of their needs, completely independent of the city.</p>
		<h5 id="Scale">Communities in context</h5>
		<p>Certain German cities require the first floor of any development be made available for retail space. This ensures that the area maintains activity throughout the day, and not let the community become a residential black hole. Instead, businesses thrive in such dense locations while also providing convenient products and services to both group members and the rest of the neighborhood.</p>
		<p>In the enterprising community, members could take this concept to the next step by establishing their own business that would not only benefit the surrounding residents but also themselves by increasing their return of investment. Such businesses could include a tool library, machine shop, 3D printing services, or even something more traditional like a restaurant that serves the food grown in their own gardens.</p>
		<p>These are just some ideas that communities could pursue. There are many more possibilities for individuals that build together and it is not uncommon for a _baugruppe_ to create a "theme" like those described above in order to attract like-minded members.</p>

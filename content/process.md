				<h4>The process of building a <i>baugruppe</i></h4>
				For the most part, <i>baugruppen</i> are multi-story, multi-family buildings (think condos) rather than detached or semi-detached housing. There is no requirement for community space or common facilities in <i>baugruppen</i>, though many incorporate them (commonly: gardens, community rooms, roof terraces). However, like co-housing, <i>baugruppen</i> incorporate a participatory planning process. The largest difference is probably that <i>baugruppen</i> are <b>generally funded without developers</b> (self-financed), whereas co-housing communities can be self-financed or developer-financed projects.

			<h5 id="lorem1">Formation</h5>

				The group meets, the early members recruit additional members, they search for experts to help them, and they try to identify a suitable site. Early conceptual designs are often produced (with outline costs) so that the members can visualize roughly what they propose to do and what it might cost. The group usually then formally constitutes itself as a co-operative, a civil legal partnership (GbR), or a home ownership association (WEG).

			<h5 id="lorem2">Planning</h5>

				This is when the group firms up the appointment of its professional team (architects, engineers etc), and identifies a project manager to oversee the construction work. At this stage the members might also obtain an 'option' to buy the site they've identified, and they will get their scheme approved by the planners. The design is then 'locked down' at this point, the costs are worked out in detail, and they get their finance lined up. In Germany the state owned bank KfW is a strong supporter of these types of projects, so funding is often relatively straight forward. The GLS Bank also has a remit to lend to community-led housing projects.

			<h5 id="lorem3">Purchase and Prepare</h5>

				At this point the group formally purchases the land, it goes out to building contractors to get firm prices and it selects the builder it wants to do the work. Berlin has a big advantage over many UK cities in that there is a good supply of reasonably priced urban plots.

			<h5 id="lorem4">Build</h5>

				This is the construction phase, so the project manager the group has hired takes care of checking the quality of the work, controlling the cash and ensuring the project is completed when it should be. Quite often the members of the group get involved in some of the work to help keep costs down â€“ so its quite common for them to tackle the final fitting out, decorating, and the installation of kitchens and bathrooms.

			<h5 id="lorem5">Occupation</h5>

				Everyone moves in and a building management committee is set up to ensure the homes are properly maintained.

		<h4 id="lorem6">Challenges</h4>

			It sounds fantastic, but sometimes things do go wrong. For example members may disagree about what they want from the project, some people leave groups at critical stages, and with any construction project there can be cost and time overruns.

		It's also exhausting--people need to be able to devote a lot of time to it, and there can be a lot of (sometimes tiresome) meetings. But a recent survey of people who had done it suggests that most rate the experience as a positive one, and they forgot their disagreements as these memories were outweighed by their delight with their achievements.
